# ✨ Tejaswi’s Portfolio

## 🌸 Why I Made This

This is my personal portfolio where I show who I am, the skills I’m learning, and the projects I’ve worked on.
It’s basically my **digital resume**, but with more personality and a design that feels modern and clean.

## 🪄 What I Did

* Structured everything with **HTML** (About, Skills, Projects, Events, Contact).
* Styled it up with **CSS** so it looks sleek and professional.
* Added **animations** so it’s not boring.
* Highlighted my **education, skills, and projects** in a simple way.
* Included a **contact form** so people can reach out directly.
* Played around with gradients, hover effects, and shadows to make it pop.

## 🛠️ Tools I Used

* **HTML & CSS** → the base of the site
* **JavaScript** → for animations and smooth effects
* **Font Awesome** → for icons
* **Google Fonts (Poppins)** → for that clean modern vibe

## 🎉 What Came Out of It

* A responsive portfolio that works on any device
* A place to showcase my **skills, education, and achievements**
* A space that highlights events I’ve participated in
* Easy way for others to **connect with me**
* And most importantly — something that feels like *me* 🌟
